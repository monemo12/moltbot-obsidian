# Daily Memory Format — Team Rule (SSoT)

## Goal
Reduce repetition and make weekly review fast while keeping traceability.

## Rule
Daily notes should be **extremely short** and only record *deltas*.

## Template (max ~5 lines)
1. **Changes**: 1–3 bullets of what changed today
2. **Decisions**: 0–2 bullets (Decision + short reason)
3. **Current State**: 1 sentence (authoritative “what’s true now”)
4. **Next**: 1–3 bullets
5. **Links**: paths to SSoT docs / deep-dive memos

## Deep-dive memos (only when needed)
Create: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
- debugging traces
- comparisons
- long rationale

## Single Source of Truth (SSoT)
For each major topic, maintain one authoritative doc (e.g. `projects/daily-tech-digest.md`).
Daily notes should link to these docs rather than copy/paste status blocks.
