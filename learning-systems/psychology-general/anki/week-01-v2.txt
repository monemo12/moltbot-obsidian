What is psychology?	Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes.<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
What are the three key components of psychology's definition?	1) Scientific (uses systematic methods)<br>2) Behavior (observable actions)<br>3) Mental processes (thoughts, feelings, memories)<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
Why is psychology considered a science?	Psychology uses systematic methods (observation, experimentation) to test claims empirically, not just common sense or speculation.<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
What was the goal of Structuralism?	To identify the "structure" of consciousness by breaking it into basic elements (sensations, feelings) through introspection.<br><br>👤 Wilhelm Wundt (1879)<br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
What was the main limitation of Structuralism?	It was too subjective - introspection reports varied widely between people, making it unreliable.<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
How did Functionalism differ from Structuralism?	Functionalism focused on the <i>function</i> of consciousness (why we think/behave) and how it helps us adapt, rather than just describing mental structure.<br><br>👤 William James (1890)<br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
What did Behaviorism reject and why?	Behaviorism rejected studying consciousness because it was too subjective. Instead, it focused only on observable behavior.<br><br>👤 John B. Watson (1913)<br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
What was the key idea of Behaviorism?	Learning occurs through conditioning - behavior is shaped by environmental rewards and punishments.<br><br>👤 B.F. Skinner (1953), <i>Science and Human Behavior</i>
What did the Cognitive Revolution bring back?	The study of mental processes (thinking, memory, problem-solving) that Behaviorism had rejected.<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
Name three contemporary approaches in psychology	Any three of:<br>• Biological (neuroscience)<br>• Cognitive<br>• Behavioral<br>• Humanistic<br>• Psychodynamic<br>• Sociocultural<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
What does the Biological approach focus on?	How the brain, nervous system, hormones, and genes influence behavior and mental processes.<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
What does the Cognitive approach study?	Mental processes such as thinking, memory, perception, and decision-making.<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
What is the Humanistic approach's main focus?	Human potential, personal growth, self-actualization, and free will.<br><br>👤 Carl Rogers & Abraham Maslow<br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
What is the Biopsychosocial Model?	The idea that most psychological phenomena require multiple perspectives: Biological, Psychological, and Social factors all interact.<br><br>👤 George Engel (1977)<br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
How would the Biological approach explain depression?	Through genetic vulnerability and brain chemistry imbalances (e.g., neurotransmitter levels like serotonin).<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 15
How would the Sociocultural approach explain differences in "normal" behavior?	What's considered normal varies across cultures (e.g., individualism vs. collectivism), shaped by cultural values and social contexts.<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
A student procrastinates before exams. Give two different explanations from different perspectives.	<b>Behavioral:</b> Procrastination is reinforced (short-term relief from anxiety).<br><b>Psychodynamic:</b> Unconscious fear of failure or success linked to past experiences.<br>(Other valid combinations accepted)<br><br>📚 Application example - Myers & DeWall (2021), Ch. 1
Why does modern psychology use multiple approaches instead of one?	Because behavior and mental processes are complex - understanding them fully requires biological, psychological, and social perspectives (Biopsychosocial Model).<br><br>📚 Myers & DeWall (2021), <i>Psychology</i> 14th ed., Ch. 1
